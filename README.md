# Rolling in Space
Insper 2024.2 Roll-a-ball game jam submission.

# Description

Rolling in Space is a straightforward game where you race against the clock to collect all the points in each level to achieve victory. Along the way, you'll navigate around simple enemies and leap over obstacles. This game was created as a learning project (my first venture into game development) so please keep in mind that it may not have the highest level of polish.
